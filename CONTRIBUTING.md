# Contributing

For now, where applicable, please follow the [Torch7 contributing guidelines](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note that this project uses [AngularJS commit conventions](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/conventions/angular.md). **Tip:** the `-m` flag can be used multiple times with `git commit` to write more descriptive messages, for example:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: add awesome new bar feature" -m "This new bar feature is funkalicious" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: This replaces the slightly less cool foo feature"
```
